## Active Recall

Retrieve information from memory instead of passively reviewing.

**Practice**:

- Close the book, write what you remember
- Flashcards: see question, produce answer from memory
- Practice tests beat re-reading notes
- Explain concepts without looking at source

**Why it works**: Retrieval strengthens memory traces. Each successful recall
creates new access paths. Even failed attempts improve later retention.

**Research**: Repeated retrieval produces 400% improvement vs. studying once.
(Karpicke & Roediger)

## Spaced Repetition

Review material at increasing intervals: 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1
month.

**Practice**:

- Use SRS software to automate scheduling
- Without software: review next day, then 3d, 7d, 14d, 30d
- Let yourself almost forget before reviewing
- Harder to recall = stronger memory formed

**Why it works**: Each retrieval at the edge of forgetting strengthens the
memory. Massed practice (cramming) produces short-term gains, long-term losses.

**The forgetting curve**: Without review, we lose ~40% in days, ~90% within a
month. Spaced review flattens this curve.

**Tools**: Anki, RemNote, Mochi, Obsidian + Spaced Repetition plugin

## Interleaving

Mix related topics (ABCABC) instead of blocking (AAABBBCCC).

**Practice**:

- Alternate between problem types during practice
- Switch subjects within study sessions
- Create mixed practice sets for review
- Don't do 20 of the same problem in a row

**Why it works**: Forces discrimination between similar concepts. Blocking lets
you pattern-match without true understanding.

**The catch**: Interleaving feels harder and less productive. This is a feature.
The difficulty improves long-term retention.

**When to block**: Start with blocked practice for brand-new material.
Interleave once you have the basics.

**Transition signals** (move to interleaving when you can):

- Solve basic problems without reference material
- Explain the core concept in your own words (Feynman test)
- Recognize which technique applies to a new problem

**Research**: 30-40% improvement on delayed tests vs. blocking.

## Elaboration

Ask "why" and "how" questions to connect new material to existing knowledge.

**Practice**:

- After learning a fact: "Why is this true?"
- "How does this relate to what I already know?"
- Generate your own examples
- Explain the steps in a procedure, not just the steps

**Why it works**: Creates semantic links to prior knowledge. More connections =
more retrieval paths = better recall.

**Limitation**: Requires background knowledge to elaborate from. Works best when
you have prior knowledge to connect to.

## Generation Effect

Producing information beats passively receiving it.

**Practice**:

- Fill-in-the-blank exercises (cloze deletion)
- Predict the answer before revealing it
- Create your own practice questions
- Write code before looking at the solution

**Why it works**: Generation activates deeper encoding—semantic elaboration,
distinctive processing, effortful retrieval.

**Counterintuitive**: Wrong answers, when corrected, can strengthen memory more
than reading the right answer directly. Struggle is productive.

## Feynman Technique

Explain concepts simply to expose gaps in understanding.

**Steps**:

1. **Choose** a concept you want to understand
2. **Explain** it in plain language, as if teaching a child
3. **Identify gaps** where you stumble, get vague, or resort to jargon
4. **Simplify** and return to source material for weak spots
5. **Repeat** until the explanation flows

**Why it works**: Combines active recall, generation, and self-explanation.
Reveals illusions of competence—you can't hide behind jargon.

**Use for**: Complex topics, interview prep, testing whether you actually
understand something or just recognize it.

## Dual Coding

Combine verbal and visual representations.

**Practice**:

- Sketch diagrams while reading
- Add images to flashcards
- Create mind maps from memory
- Draw system architectures, don't just describe them

**Why it works**: Verbal and visual memory are separate channels. Encoding in
both creates two independent retrieval paths.

**Caution**: Poorly designed visuals increase cognitive load. Simple >
elaborate. The visual should clarify, not decorate.

## Chunking

Group information into meaningful units to work within memory limits.

**Practice**:

- Phone numbers: 973-820-5846 not 9738205846
- Acronyms: ACID for database transactions
- Patterns: See `git rebase -i` as one concept, not four tokens
- Build chunks from smaller chunks (hierarchy)

**Why it works**: Working memory holds ~4-7 items. A chunk counts as one item
regardless of internal complexity. Experts chunk more aggressively.

**In practice**: When learning a new domain, consciously look for patterns that
can become single units. Name them.

## Supporting Factors

### Sleep

Sleep consolidates memory, particularly slow-wave sleep.

- Post-learning sleep stabilizes and enhances memories
- Sleep before learning prepares encoding capacity
- Naps help; all-nighters actively hurt retention
- Fatigue sabotages retention

### Deliberate Practice

Not just repetition—structured practice targeting weaknesses.

- Focus on skills slightly beyond current ability
- Get immediate feedback
- High concentration, not autopilot
- Quality matters more than hours logged

The "10,000 hour rule" oversimplifies. Deliberate practice explains ~26% of
performance variance—significant but not everything.

### Metacognition

Thinking about your thinking.

- **Plan**: What do I know? What's my approach?
- **Monitor**: Is this working? Am I actually learning or just busy?
- **Evaluate**: What did I miss? What should I adjust?

The ability to accurately assess your own understanding is a skill. Develop it.

### Intellectual Humility

Admitting what you don't know signals mastery, not weakness.

**Strong opinions, loosely held:**

- Have conviction based on experience
- Actively seek information that would change your mind
- Update publicly when you're wrong
- The best outcome is sometimes being proven wrong

**Why it works**: Pretending to know everything erodes trust. Leaders who model
fallibility create environments where others grow. "I don't know yet, but here's
how I'll find out" is a strength.

**The paradox**: Expertise enables humility. Beginners overestimate their
knowledge (Dunning-Kruger). Masters know how much they don't know.

## What Doesn't Work

| Technique              | Problem                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Re-reading             | Feels productive, builds familiarity not recall                            |
| Highlighting           | Passive; no retrieval or elaboration                                       |
| Learning styles (VAK)  | No evidence that matching "style" helps; everyone benefits from multimodal |
| Cramming               | Works for tomorrow's test, gone next week                                  |
| Blocked practice only  | Feels smoother, transfers worse                                            |
| Passive video watching | Understanding is not retention                                             |

The techniques that feel easiest often work worst. Fluent reading creates an
illusion of learning. Test yourself to know what you actually know.

## Building a System

Minimum viable learning workflow:

1. **Capture**: Take notes in your own words (generation, not transcription)
2. **Process**: Convert notes to questions or flashcards (forces active framing)
3. **Review**: Follow a spaced repetition schedule
4. **Test**: Practice problems, teach-backs, self-quizzes
5. **Sleep**: Non-negotiable

### Example: Learning React Query in 2 Weeks

**Days 1-3: Capture** — Read docs and tutorials. Take notes in your own words,
not transcripts. Sketch the mental model (dual coding).

**Days 2-5: Process** — Convert notes to Anki cards. Frame as questions: "When
does React Query refetch by default?" Force active recall framing.

**Days 3-14: Review** — Daily SRS review, 10-15 minutes. Let the algorithm
schedule; trust the spacing.

**Days 5-14: Test** — Build a small project. Explain your cache strategy out
loud (Feynman). Debug without docs when possible.

**Throughout: Sleep** — Consolidation happens overnight. No late-night cramming.

Phases overlap. You're still capturing while processing, still processing while
testing. The system is a loop, not a sequence.

The system matters less than consistency. Pick tools you'll actually use.

## Learning to Learn Faster

The meta-skill is **metacognition**—noticing when you're learning vs. just busy.

### Accelerators

**Shorten feedback loops.** Test yourself immediately after learning, not days
later. Wrong answers surface gaps faster than re-reading.

**Systematize, don't improvise.** Pick one SRS tool, one note system, one
practice rhythm. Deciding how to learn burns time you could spend learning.

**Learn domains, not just skills.** Each new domain (language, instrument,
sport) trains the learning process itself. The pattern—confusion → frustration →
competence → fluency—becomes familiar.

### The Counterintuitive Truth

What feels slow often works fast:

| Feels Inefficient      | Actually Effective Because                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Struggle and confusion | Effortful encoding strengthens memory     |
| Retrieval failure      | Failed attempts prime later success       |
| Interleaving topics    | Forces discrimination, not pattern-match  |
| Spacing over cramming  | Edge-of-forgetting retrieval consolidates |

Fluent re-reading feels productive but evaporates. The techniques that feel
hardest produce the most durable learning.

### The Leverage Point

Ten minutes of Anki beats two hours of "I should really review that."

Knowing the techniques isn't the bottleneck—running the system daily is. Build
the habit; the learning compounds.
