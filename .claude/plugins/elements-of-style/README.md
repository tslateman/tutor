# The Elements of Style - Claude Code Plugin

A Claude Code plugin providing William Strunk Jr.'s _The Elements of Style_
(1918) as a reference skill for clear, precise writing.

## Purpose

This plugin gives Claude access to Strunk's foundational writing guidance when
working on documentation, user-facing text, or any prose that needs clarity and
proper style.

## What's Inside

The plugin provides:

- **Skill**: `writing-clearly-and-concisely` - Guidance on when and how to use
  Strunk's rules
- **Reference**: Complete 1918 text with all rules, examples, and usage guidance
  (~12,000 tokens)

The reference contains:

1. **Elementary Rules of Usage** - Seven fundamental grammar and punctuation
   rules
2. **Elementary Principles of Composition** - Eleven rules for clear, effective
   writing
3. **Words and Expressions Commonly Misused** - An alphabetical guide to usage
   pitfalls

## Usage

Once installed, Claude will automatically use the
`writing-clearly-and-concisely` skill when appropriate. The skill:

- Warns about the 12,000-token reference size
- Lists all rules at a glance
- Suggests dispatching a subagent for copyediting when context is limited
- Only loads the full reference when actively writing or editing prose
